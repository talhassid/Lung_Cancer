In the United States, lung cancer strikes 225,000 people every year, and accounts for $12 billion in health care costs. 
Early detection is critical to give patients the best chance at recovery and survival.

Project description:
====================

In the project, you are provided with a data set of thousands of high-resolution CT lung scans. 
The goal is to develop an algorithm that accurately determines when lesions in the lungs are cancerous.
We will concentrate on deep-learning based algorithms, which are particularly useful for large sets of images.
No prior knowledge is required. However, background in machine learning is an advantage.
